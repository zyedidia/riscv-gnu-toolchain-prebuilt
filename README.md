# Prebuilt RISC-V binaries

The assets of this repository contain pre-built Linux binaries for running the
RISC-V GNU cross compiler toolchain. The GNU toolchain was compiled by running
the `build.sh` script (builds with multilib support). To install, download the
tarball from the releases and extract it to `/opt/riscv`.
